# IrisFilter_kobotake - Work In Progress
Actually it's a KobAtake, I accidentaly misstyped algorithm's authors name. It is image filter based on paper titles 'Convergence Index Filter for Vector Fields' by Hidefumi Kobatake and published in 1999, filter designed to detect and boost objects with smooth edges. Particularly cancers. 

Unfortunately some math problem I cannot locate breaks the program. Requires more time to find in a spare moment.
